# simpleATMController

The main task in this project was to create a secure ATM Controller class that does not expose the PIN to the user or the ATM and only checks if the attempted PIN is correct without ever using the actual correct PIN. There are 3 classes: ATMController, Card, and Account. I designed these classes in a way to ensure that the user only interacts with the ATMController class by making an object of type ATMController and using its methods. The insertCardPIN method in the ATMController class checks if attemptedPIN is correct by comparing the result of hashing attemptedPIN with the result of hashing the real PIN. The hash function used was the built-in one in Java. This way, the ATM never gets access to the correct PIN, just the result of hashing it which is secure because one can't reverse a hash function.
